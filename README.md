# Physical Home LAN and Linux Server Setup

This repository contains a detailed PDF documenting the design and setup of my **physical home lab**, where I built and operated a real home LAN with a dedicated Linux server.

## Overview

The lab was created to gain hands-on experience with real-world networking and system administration concepts beyond virtual machines. A consumer-grade router and a repurposed desktop system were used to simulate a small-scale production-like environment.

The setup focuses on **practical infrastructure operations**, security-aware configuration, and understanding how networking and servers behave in a real physical environment.

## What This Lab Covers

- Configuring a home router and LAN environment
- Installing and configuring Linux on a physical machine
- Converting a desktop system into a headless Linux server
- Static IP configuration and DHCP reservation
- Secure remote access using SSH
- Firewall configuration and service exposure control
- Hosting internal services within the LAN
- End-to-end troubleshooting of networking and system issues

## Purpose

The goal of this lab was not to follow a predefined guide, but to independently design, configure, and operate a working networked system. This helped build a strong foundation in:

- Network engineering fundamentals
- Linux system administration
- Secure infrastructure setup
- Day-to-day operational thinking

## Documentation

The PDF included in this repository walks through the full setup process, design decisions, and configuration steps used to build the lab.

## Relevance

This project reflects practical experience relevant to infrastructure, cloud, and security-focused roles, where understanding networking, Linux systems, and secure configuration is essential.
